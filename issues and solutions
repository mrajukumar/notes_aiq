We need to make changes to the `hashgetall` method in multiple classes within the `RT_Dashboard.py` file. Specifically, you want to change the database parameter from "0" to "1" for these classes:

 

1. `getagentready` -> `0 to 1`

2. `getcontactsonhold` -> `0 to 1`

3. `getrtagentsAcw` -> `0 to 1`

4. `getrtragentserror` -> `0 to 1`

5. `getagentsnonproductive` -> `0 to 1`

6. `getrtagentstates` -> `0 to 1`

7. `getcontactsonholdbyqueue` -> `0 to 1`

8. `getcontactsonholdbyagent` -> `0 to 1`

9. `getagentstats` -> `0 to 1`

10. `getagentstatesdrilldown` -> `0 to 1` (here we need to change in 2 hashgetall methods in the same class)
When there is need of change in the MSSQL password ,we need to update the encoded base 64 password in the environment files in the server.
We need to change three environment files.
1.envfile.core in the /opt/aiq-reports/core
2.env.aiqscheduler in the /opt/aiq-reports/scheduler
3.envfile.uaa in the /opt/aiq-reports/uaa
In the envfile.core and env.aiqscheduler files, we need to update the database key with the encoded base64 key.

But in the envfile.uaa file to get the encrypted password execute the below command in the server in the “/opt/aiq-reports” path.
Command: sudo docker exec uaa-core bash -c "python3.6 manage.py encrypt Password"
Eg: sudo docker exec uaa-core bash -c "python3.6 manage.py encrypt Dosm@1973"
